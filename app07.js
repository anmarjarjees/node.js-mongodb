/* 
Summary of updateOne() usage:
- updateOne() is used to update a single document that matches the specified filter criteria.
- It returns an object that contains:
    - matchedCount: The number of documents matched by the filter.
    - modifiedCount: The number of documents that were actually modified.
- Always handle potential errors in asynchronous operations.
